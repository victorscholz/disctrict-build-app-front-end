Welcome to District Build NYC

This application uses React with Mapbox and is an interactive map of New York City that shows every historical building/landmark. You can click on any one of the 37,000 highlighted buildings and view information about it, pulled directly from NYC Open Data. This puts the building in your visit list and allows you to scroll through that information any time during your session. You can zoom in, pan/rotate the map, and use the search function to travel the city.

To get started simply clone this repository, run 'npm install', and 'npm start'.
To save buildings to your visit list you will need to clone the rails back end https://github.com/victorscholz/district-build-app-api, and run 'rails s'.
